        My name is Angel Prost. My major is Communication and Rhetorical Studies interesting in applying different communication skills to a variety of careers. I am a instructional assistant for student athletes at SU. I speak 2 languages. English and Mandarin. I like editing videos that I vlog when I hang out with friends and families. My new favorite tv show is Derry Girls. I love reading books on my kindle. I am currently studying in the US by myself while my family is in Taiwan so I facetime them a lot.
